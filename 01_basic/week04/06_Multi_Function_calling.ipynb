For instance, if a user asks, *\"What's the stock price of Google and what time is it in Tokyo?\"*, the model can intelligently decide to call both the `get_stock_price` and `get_current_time` functions simultaneously. \n",

We will define a comprehensive set of tools and then feed the model complex queries that require multiple tools to be called in parallel.
